[Dr. Jiehan Zhou](/jiehan_zhou/), leader of the **CogTwins** lab at *Shandong University of Science and Technology*, his proposal for a special issue on *Industrial Large Models (ILMs)* has been accepted by the *Computer Science Journal Special Issues and Conference Proceedings Proposals*. This special issue will be published in the *Applied Soft Computing* journal.


The special issue will cover important topics, including multi-modal data fusion, predictive maintenance, AI-driven supply chain optimization, and industrial intelligence. Industrial Large Models (ILMs) are powerful AI models used in industrial applications, capable of handling large amounts of different types of data (like text, images, and sound) and supporting automation in areas like production and supply chains.


Stay tuned for the call for papers and contribute to this exciting initiative on Industrial Large Models!
