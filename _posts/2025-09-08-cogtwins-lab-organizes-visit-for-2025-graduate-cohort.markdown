On the afternoon of September 8, the **CogTwins Lab** organized the 2025 cohort of new graduate students to visit the university’s advanced manufacturing production line and the intelligent mining modeling and simulation center. During the on-site observation of automated production line operations and dynamic demonstrations of simulation systems, the students gained an in-depth understanding of the practical applications of **smart manufacturing and digital twins**.

Through a full-life-cycle virtual model of intelligent mining, researchers demonstrated the digital simulation process from extraction, transportation to management, as well as its important value in optimizing production, ensuring safety, and promoting green mining practices.

This visit broadened the students’ perspectives in interdisciplinary fields such as complex system modeling and simulation, stimulated their research interest, and laid a practical foundation for their future studies and research.

Sincere thanks to hosts **Prof. Jinrui Wang** and **Prof. Yongtang Bao** for organizing this informative visit.
