Good news! Cogtwinsee Siyuan Sun has successfully applied for a visiting scholar program at the University of Toronto (Top-20 in the world and a significant hub for Modern AI, where Jeffrey Hinton, the AI god and recipient of the Nobel Prize and Turing Award, works). His application has been approved! Congratulations, Siyuan!
好消息！实验室孙思源同学申请多伦多大学（全球排名前20的顶尖学府，同时也是人工智能的重要发源地，AI教父诺贝尔奖图灵奖获得者Jeffrey Hinton的所在单位）访学项目，已经顺利通过审核，获得录取！祝贺思源！
