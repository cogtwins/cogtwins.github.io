[Dr. Jiehan Zhou](/jiehan_zhou/), leader of the **CogTwins** lab at *Shandong University of Science and Technology*, has achieved a big milestone! His proposal for a special issue on *Industrial Large Models (ILMs)* has been accepted by the *Computer Science Journal Special Issues and Conference Proceedings Proposals*. This special issue will be published in the *Applied Soft Computing* journal, an **SCI Q1** journal.

The special issue will cover important topics, including multi-modal data fusion, predictive maintenance, AI-driven supply chain optimization, and industrial intelligence. Industrial Large Models (ILMs) are powerful AI models used in industrial applications, capable of handling large amounts of different types of data (like text, images, and sound) and supporting automation in areas like production and supply chains.

We congratulate Dr. Zhou and invite researchers to submit their work to this upcoming issue! 

Here are image of the proposal details:
