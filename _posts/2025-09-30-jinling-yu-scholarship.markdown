Our graduate student, Ms. Jinling Yu, Evelyn, has been awarded a prestigious SDUST Scholarship to support a three-month research visit to the University of Auckland in New Zealand. During her visit, Jinling will be collaborating with leading researchers on the topic of Industrial Intelligent Agents. This project aligns perfectly with our lab's focus on embodied AI and aims to develop advanced autonomous systems for industrial applications.
