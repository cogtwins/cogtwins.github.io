Recently, the Cogtwins Lab consisting of students and teachers visited Haier’s Appliance Group to conduct enterprise research. Representatives of the Lab’s member, including Cui Huanqing and Bao Han, held in-depth discussions with leaders from Haier’s Strategic Department, Haier Group’s cooperative education office, and the appliance research and development team. The two sides engaged in exchanges on topics such as technology development, personnel training, and technology transfer. They reached a preliminary consensus on promoting further deep integration of industry, university, and research, and jointly explored opportunities for innovation in the field of smart appliances.
