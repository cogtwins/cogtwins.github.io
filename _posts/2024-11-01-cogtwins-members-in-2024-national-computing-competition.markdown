We’re thrilled to share the exciting news from the **2024 National Intelligent Computing Innovation Competition (Pioneer Cup) 2024年全国大学生计算机系统能力大赛**: two outstanding teams, **Hilbert and Kolmogorov**, have achieved a remarkable milestone! Out of nearly 100 teams from across the country, these two teams, guided by the talented CogTwins (Cognitive Industrial Digital Twins Lab) of the **School of Computer Science at Shandong University of Science and Technology (Qingdao)**, were shortlisted in the top 16 and have advanced to the finals.

This accomplishment reflects the dedication and innovative spirit of our participants, who have demonstrated an exceptional ability to push boundaries in the field of intelligent computing. Team members **Si Yuan** and **Yu Jinling** were pivotal in driving their teams' success, blending technical skills with critical thinking to solve complex challenges.


Let’s celebrate this achievement and cheer on our CogTwins teams as they represent our school on the national stage! Congratulations once again to **Si Yuan**, **Yu Jinling**, and all the members of Hilbert and Kolmogorov for their outstanding work and commitment.
